### Rolling update procedure:

1. Verify that the ansible inventory file is accurate and complete.
```bash
ceph-ansible -i ceph_inventory -m ping
```

2. Verify and document the current health and ceph versions in use throughout the cluster.
```bash
ceph -s
ceph tell mon.* version
ceph tell osd.* version
```

3. Run the playbook.
```bash
ceph-ansible-playbook -i ceph_inventory playbooks/rolling_update.yml
```

4. Verify the health of the cluster.
```bash
ceph -s
```
 - verify status returns to HEALTH_OK
 - verify that the expected number of mons are present
 - verify that the expected number of osds are present, "up", and "in"
 - verify that all placement groups are "active+clean" (a few may be "scrubbing" or "deep_scrubbing". This is okay.)

```
ceph tell mon.* version
ceph tell osd.* version
```
Verify all daemons report the expected new version.
